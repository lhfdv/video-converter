# video-converter
Because all online solutions are bloated, I decided to create my own. Some file sharing solutions don't allow WebM, so I need to convert them to MP4 first. I intended this to be just a WebM to MP4 conversion tool, but it seems like the implementation with FastAPI is easier than I thought.
